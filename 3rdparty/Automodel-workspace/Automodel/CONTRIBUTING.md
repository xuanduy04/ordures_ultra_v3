## Building Automodel container

* Testing and validation occurs through the Automodel container. This is the primary and recommended path for development. Container can be built using the following command:

```bash
# Set build arguments
export AUTOMODEL_INSTALL=vlm #[fa, moe, vlm]
export BASE_IMAGE=pytorch #[cuda, pytorch]

# Dependency install options [True, False]
export INSTALL_BITSANDBYTES=True
export INSTALL_DEEPEP=True
export INSTALL_MAMBA=True
export INSTALL_TE=True

docker build -f docker/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg AUTOMODEL_INSTALL=$AUTOMODEL_INSTALL \
    --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=$BASE_IMAGE \
    --build-arg INSTALL_BITSANDBYTES=$INSTALL_BITSANDBYTES \
    --build-arg INSTALL_DEEPEP=$INSTALL_DEEPEP \
    --build-arg INSTALL_MAMBA=$INSTALL_MAMBA \
    --build-arg INSTALL_TE=$INSTALL_TE \
    -t automodel --target=automodel_final .
```

* All testing is currently executed with PyTorch base image. This is the recommended installation path.

* Run the following command to start your container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash --runtime nvidia --gpus all automodel
```

## Mounting Automodel repository into the container

* When mounting Automodel repo onto an existing container built with `BASE_IMAGE=pytorch`, execute the following additional steps:

```bash
sed -i '/\[tool\.uv\]/r <path_to_Automodel>/docker/common/uv-pytorch.toml' pyproject.toml
mv <path_to_Automodel>/docker/common/uv-pytorch.lock <path_to_Automodel>/uv.lock
```

* Limitations of uv require injection of additional configuration to skip `torch` installation and replace existing uv.lock.

## Installing dependencies from source

* The follow list of dependencies are dependent on underlying CUDA version and may require source installation:
  * bitsandbytes
  * causal-conv1d
  * DeepEP
  * grouped_gemm
  * mamba
  * TransformerEngine

* Please refer to the Automodel Dockerfile for source install steps: [link](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile#L53-L122)

### MoE Dependency

* Requires [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=20.04&target_type=deb_network)

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cudnn-cuda-12
pip install transformer-engine[pytorch]==2.8.0
# Flash-attn version should be selected to satisfy TE requirements
# https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/blob/v2.4/transformer_engine/pytorch/attention/dot_product_attention/utils.py#L108
pip install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1
pip install grouped_gemm
```

## Development Dependencies

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies.

New required dependencies can be added by `uv add $DEPENDENCY`.

Adding a new dependency will update UV's lock-file. Please check this into your branch:

```bash
git add uv.lock pyproject.toml
git commit -s -m "build: Adding dependencies"
git push
```

## Linting and Formatting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.

Installation:

```bash
pip install ruff
```

Format:

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

## Adding Documentation

If your contribution involves documentation changes, please refer to the [Documentation Development](docs/documentation.md) guide for detailed instructions on building and serving the documentation.

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
