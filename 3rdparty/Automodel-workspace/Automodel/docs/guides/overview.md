## Recipes and End-to-End Examples

NeMo Automodel is organized around two key concepts: recipes and components.

Recipes are executable scripts configured with YAML files. Each recipe defines its own training and validation loop, orchestrated through a `step_scheduler`. It specifies the model, dataset, loss function, optimizer, scheduler, checkpointing, and distributed training settings—allowing end-to-end training with a single command.

Components are modular, plug-and-play building blocks referenced using the `_target_` field. These include models, datasets, loss functions, and distribution managers. Recipes assemble these components, making it easy to swap them out to change precision, distribution strategy, dataset, or task—without modifying the training loop itself.

This page maps the ready-to-run recipes found in the `examples/` directory to their intended use cases, representative model families, and the most relevant how-to guides.

## Large Language Models (LLM)
This section provides practical recipes and configurations for working with large language models across three core workflows: fine-tuning, pretraining, and knowledge distillation.

### Fine-Tuning

End-to-end fine-tuning recipes for many open models. Each subfolder contains YAML configurations showing task setups (e.g., SQuAD, HellaSwag), precision options (e.g., FP8), and parameter-efficient methods (e.g., LoRA/QLoRA).

- Folder: [examples/llm_finetune](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/tree/main/examples/llm_finetune)
- Representative families: Llama 3.1/3.2/3.3, Gemma 2/3, Falcon 3, Mistral/Mixtral, Nemotron, Granite, Starcoder, Qwen, Baichuan, GLM, OLMo, Phi, GPT-OSS, Moonlight
- How-to guide: [LLM finetuning](llm/finetune.md)

### Pretraining

Starter configurations and scripts for pretraining with datasets from different stacks (e.g., PyTorch, Megatron Core).

- Folder: [examples/llm_pretrain](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/tree/main/examples/llm_pretrain)
- Example models: GPT-2 baseline, NanoGPT, DeepSeek-V3, Moonlight 16B TE (Slurm)
- How-to guides:
