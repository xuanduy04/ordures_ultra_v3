# Model Optimization

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for optimizing models with Megatron Bridge using NVIDIA ModelOpt. Learn how to apply various optimization techniques to improve inference efficiency while maintaining model quality.

## Overview

NVIDIA ModelOpt provides a suite of model optimization techniques for improving inference performance:

- **Quantization** - Convert models from high-precision (FP32/BF16) to lower-precision formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) for efficient deployment
- **Distillation** - Transfer knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model to a smaller, faster student model
- **Pruning** - Reduce model size by removing layers (depth) or reducing dimensions (width) such as attention heads and hidden sizes


## Quick Navigation

### I want to

**🔧 Quantize a pretrained model**
→ See the [Post-Training Quantization section](quantization.md#post-training-quantization-ptq) for complete PTQ workflows (quantize, resume and generate, export)

**🏋️ Train with quantization**
→ Check the [Quantization-Aware Training section](quantization.md#quantization-aware-training-qat) for QAT workflows
